# AvatarFriends (with Redux)

AvatarFriends is a simple application that utilizes Redux to manage state. As the user types within the search field, the avatars are simultaneously filtered to display what is being searched. Avatars are initially generated through two API calls:

[Adorable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io/) to get the images.
[JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to get the fake user data.

The different images are generated from the adorable avatars API by passing down an ID prop which is provided by the placeholder data. The number of cards are generated by the number of users returned from the second API. This API returns an object of ten users, which is why ten cards are returned.
